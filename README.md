Sons of Odin
============

Sons of Odin is a modification to Crusader Kings III that attempts to improve the gameplay experience
and immersion of playing as or against a viking. It tries to address several shortcomings with the 
base game that can be frustrating to players:

 * Tries to solve overseas border gore that makes Europe look like 16th Century India.
 * Tries to add sorely missing flavor events from CK2.

With those two pillars in mind, the modification makes the following changes:

 * Removes all conquest CBs from Vikings. Vikings can no longer randomly declare war upon a target but
   instead get an one-time use casus belli (per character) that allows them to settle somewhere else, not
   unlikey the Hungarian Invasion CB. Upon victory, the victor loses all their titles and vassals, and
   instead adopts the government form of whatever title they conquered.
 * * The ruler gets an option to adopt the faith of their new capital.
 * * The ruler can only declare such a war once.
 * * The CB can be used against any coastal target in Europe.
 * * The CB targets a title of similar rank to your own. Counts can take counties, dukes can take counties
     or duchies, and kings can take kingdoms, duchies or counties.
 * * The CB may only be used once per lifetime.
 * Additionally, to further simulate history, when raiding rulers, they may opt to give you a chance to 
   become their vassal just like it did for the duke of Normandy. You will be asked to adopt your liege's
   faith. Your old titles will be given away and made independent, and you will instead gain the duchy
   offered.
 * To ease the pain of losing your old holdings, you are given special event troops.

As for new content, the mod adds a lot of flavor events and decisions, many of them ported over from 
Crusader Kings II, such as holding a Great Blot, the ability to appoint Shield Maidens and more. I also
plan to add brand new content in general.

FAQ

* *[The Paradox Mod policy](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/updated-14-06-18-rules-for-user-made-mods-and-edits-of-pds-games.708039/) states that you cannot put a license on your modification, why is this mod licensed under the GPL-3.0?*

  This is specifically talking about rule 4: 
  > 4) The User Mod may not include ANY kind of license or claim of copyright distributed with the mod (You may have a Credits section).
  
  I am 100% convinced that this is not legally allowed, and thus I do not respect this ridiculous rule. All
  contents of my mod have been made by me. The scripts I wrote from scratch and the art assets are my own
  work. Rule 4 is in direct conflict with copyright law, as far as I see it.

  In the past, Paradox also had another rule, namely the controversial rule #1:

  > The mod may not have an external public forum, they can have one for their internal development use but not disclosed to the general membership here, nor allowing them to join.

  Rule #1 **was** even more ridiculous. This is an actual infringement of your right to freedom of speech
  (assuming you live in a country that has such a right), Paradox cannot control the creation of a platform
  nor can they control your right to discuss something in a location of your choice. They have since lifted
  this rule.

  The fact Rule #1 even existed at all makes me question the legality of Rule #4.

  Now, Paradox has explained why they do this, in a comment by Paradox forum manager Castellon:

  > If you put something in your mod that we have planned for a future DLC say, we cannot have you coming back and saying you thought of it so you own it and we cannot use it.

  This is not a concern, as you cannot own copyright to an idea or game play concept (see: Blizzard Entertainment vs. Valve Software).
