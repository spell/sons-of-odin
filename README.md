Sons of Odin
============

Sons of Odin is a modification to Crusader Kings III that attempts to improve the gameplay experience
and immersion of playing as or against a viking. It tries to address several shortcomings with the 
base game that can be frustrating to players:

 * Tries to solve overseas border gore that makes Europe look like 16th Century India.
 * Tries to add sorely missing flavor events from CK2.

With those two pillars in mind, the modification makes the following changes:

 * Removes all conquest CBs from Vikings. Vikings can no longer randomly declare war upon a target but
   instead get an one-time use casus belli (per character) that allows them to settle somewhere else, not
   unlikey the Hungarian Invasion CB. Upon victory, the victor loses all their titles and vassals, and
   instead adopts the government form of whatever title they conquered.
 * * The ruler gets an option to adopt the faith of their new capital.
 * * The ruler can only declare such a war once.
 * * The CB can be used against any coastal target in Europe.
 * * The CB targets a title of similar rank to your own. Counts can take counties, dukes can take counties
     or duchies, and kings can take kingdoms, duchies or counties.
 * * The CB may only be used once per lifetime.
 * Additionally, to further simulate history, when raiding rulers, they may opt to give you a chance to 
   become their vassal just like it did for the duke of Normandy. You will be asked to adopt your liege's
   faith. Your old titles will be given away and made independent, and you will instead gain the duchy
   offered.
 * To ease the pain of losing your old holdings, you are given special event troops.

As for new content, the mod adds a lot of flavor events and decisions, many of them ported over from 
Crusader Kings II, such as holding a Great Blot, the ability to appoint Shield Maidens and more. I also
plan to add brand new content in general.
