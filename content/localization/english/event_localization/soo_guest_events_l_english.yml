    soo_guest.0001.t: "The Hero of [warrior_woman_home.GetNameNoTooltip]"
    soo_guest.0001.desc: "Recently you have been hearing rumors about a skilled warrior from [warrior_woman_home.GetNameNoTooltip], who single-handedly defeated a group of marauders attacking their village.\n\nToday, this warrior requested an audience with you. To your surprise, the warrior bending the knee before you is a woman. She speaks with a determined voice: \"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], please grant me the honor to die in battle.\"\n\nYou aren't sure what to make of it, but if she is really as skilled as they say she is, then she could come in useful."
    soo_guest.0001.desc.zealot: "Lately your court has been talking about a warrior blessed by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] themselves. Tales reach your ears of a warrior who fights with speed and strength unlike that of any man, taking down vast swathes of enemies all on their own.\n\nToday, that warrior has requested an audience with you. She introduces herself as [warrior_woman.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], and is quick to distance herself from any claims of divine power, but she does say to have been chosen by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName] as [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodHerHis] champion.\n\n\"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], allow me to fight for you in battle. Let me take my blade to our enemies, those that would dishonor [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]!\""
    soo_guest.0001.a: "[warrior_woman.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would make an exceptional [soo_shield_maiden|E]."
    soo_guest.0001.a.zealot: "This [soo_shield_maiden|E] must have been sent by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName]!"
    soo_guest.0001.b: "A woman fighting as my champion? Unlikely."
